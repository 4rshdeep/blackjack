# blackjack

Goal of this is to find a solution to a real problem using ideas from sequential decision making under uncertainty (Markov Decision Processes). And, the task is to compute the policy for an optimal player. The best play is defined as the action (hit/stand/double/split) that maximizes the expected return. Run ./compile.sh to compile the code and ./run.sh to generate the policy for the game of blackjack.
